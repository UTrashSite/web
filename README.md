# The UTrashSite Project
An attempt to make a better version of the school student web service

## Please help contribute to this repository!
The plan is to use Firebase as a back end, for authentication and database services

## Things to consider:

* make a web app using HTML, CSS, JS, maybe Bootstrap
* Firebase as a back end
* eventually port to a mobile app using flutter
